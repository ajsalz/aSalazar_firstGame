# aSalazar_firstGame

UPDATE #1: BASE GAME
Time: 4 hours (for reasons explained below)

I followed the written tutorial here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html

I accidently deleted my first game when I tried to commit to git for the first time so I ended up going through the tutorial twice. The first pass took me about 2 hours including debugging because I can't spell. The second time about another 1 to 1.5 hours. Figuring out git took me almost 30 minutes. For some reason, my files weren't showing up despite me picking the folder. I finally got it to work so ~yay~
