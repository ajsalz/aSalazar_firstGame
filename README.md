# aSalazar_firstGame

Hello! My base code is from this tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html

NOTE: I accidently deleted my first game so to save time I did copy/paste code from the tutorial instead of going through it. However, I still had to go back through and add all the node/other stuff and edit some parts too. 

Update #1: Base tutorial (~3–4 hours):
My intital time was around 2–2.5 hours. However, when trying to commit to git the first time, I messed up and it deleted my whole project so I had to start over so that was really sick and awesome. 

Figuring out git took me almost 30 minutes and even now, I'm not sure if I'm doing it right so haha.
